# Coding Quiz Challenge
A simple timed quiz comprised of five questions. Time counts down once you start the quiz, and any wrong answers will result in the timer moving closer to zero. The quiz is over either when all five questions have been answered, or time runs out. Players will have 100 seconds to complete the quiz.

After the quiz ends, players have the opportunity to record their high scores and check their rank on the leaderboard.

<p><b>6/8:</b> After a couple of days racking my brain trying to code a countdown timer that works, I finally looked at the class activities for anything that would be helpful and I found an activity for a timer. ðŸ˜‘ So I followed the same format as the activity and, voila! A countdown timer that counts down from 100 and opens an alert when the timer reaches zero. The next step is to add an event listener to start the timer when the user clicks the [Start Quiz] button.
<p><b>6/13:</b> Main focus of today was getting the styling how I wanted. It took some time figuring out how to position everything, but I can do all things with Google who strengthens me.
<p><b>6/14:</b> Slowly starting to get the functionality of the cards right, but I can't quite figure out how to store the questions/answers and how to move from one question to the next in as few lines of code as possible. I'm sure that I could create separate functions for every element and just call it a day, but I want to accomplish this in as few lines of code as possible.
